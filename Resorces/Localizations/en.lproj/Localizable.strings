Take an iPhone/iPod into your hand as a revolver (\"Home\" button has to be on the bottom and you have to see the screen). Place a forefinger opposite the drawn trigger.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lower your gun to the arm-distance, and be ready to make a shot fast. Wait for the command \"FIRE!\", then raise your arm and shoot two-six times in a row. Number of shoots differs depending on the level of the opponent. For example:</p><ul><li>Junior  and Citizen - two times in a row</li><li>Street fighter and Mercenary - three times in a row</li><li>Duelist and Killer - four times in a row</li><li>Head Hunter and Hero of Duels - five times in a row</li><li>Grave-digger and Angel of Death - six times in a row</li></ul><p>The one who shoots first becomes a winner in the first round. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duel consists of three rounds, therefore each of the opponents has a chance to prove the case. To become a winner, you have to be faster at least in two rounds out of three. The winner takes away 10 % of the opponent's money.</p><p> </p><h3>Attention</h3><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At “PRACTICE” mode, money which you have won isn&#039;t set off.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you drop out iPhone/iPod at a shot, fix it by adhesive tape. It&#039;s a joke, but be careful anyway.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expanded descriptions of rules watch at our Youtube channel, click \"VIDEO MANUAL\".</p>";
