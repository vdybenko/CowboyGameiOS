Wait for the command \"FIRE!\", then raise your arm and shoot two-six times in a row. Number of shots differs depending on the level of the opponent. For example:</p><ul><li>Slave and Refugee or Runaway - two times in a row</li><li>Free Man and Gunfighter - three times in a row</li><li>Bounty Hunter Apprentice and Bounty Hunter - four times in a row</li><li>Lawman - five times in a row</li><li>Grave-digger and Angel of Death - six times in a row</li></ul><p>The one who shoots first becomes a winner in the first round. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A duel consists of three rounds, therefore each of the opponents has a chance to prove the case. To become a winner, you have to be faster at least in two rounds out of three. The winner takes away 10% of the opponent's money.</p><p> </p><h3>Attention</h3><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At “PRACTICE” mode, the money you have won isn&#039;t set off.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you drop the iPhone/iPod at a shot, fix it by adhesive tape.
